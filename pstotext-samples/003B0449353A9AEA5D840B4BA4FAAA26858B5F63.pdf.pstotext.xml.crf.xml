      <abstract>Abstract Production of software is growing at a phenomenal rate worldwide. In addition, the increasingly global business climate has accelerated the need for business software. There are too few software engineers to produce and maintain software to meet this demand. One possible solution to correcting this shortfall is reeducating existing non-software employees to become software engineers. For the past two years, the Industry/University (I/U) subgroup of the Working Group on Software Engineering Education and Training (WGSEET) has been investigating active collaborations between companies and universities in which employees without formal software education are reeducated to become software engineers.

    <body>1. Introduction 
In its annual report (Worldwide Software Market Forecast Summary 2001-2005 [15]), 
International Data Corp. has projected a growth rate of 11.8% for companies in the market of 
developing and deploying software applications in the year 2002, indicating rapid growth in the 
development and use of software. However, the number of software professionals available to 
develop and maintain this software is limited and is not growing at a rate equal to the growth rate 
of software. This lack of software professionals is also occurring in countries such as Canada, 
India, and most countries in Europe. 
Educational institutions are expanding efforts to increase the number of software engineering 
graduates [13], but the rate of production is not keeping up with demand. The reeducation of 
existing non-software personnel to fill software engineering positions is one logical approach to 
meet this shortfall. Indeed, some companies have entered into cooperative partnerships with 
academic institutions to retrain employees with domain knowledge in order to retain this valuable 
resource [6]. In addition, various efforts have identified the need for incorporating a strong 
industry perspective into software engineering education programs [7, 8, 12, 14]. Thus, the 
construction of a collaborative relationship between industry and academic partners to reeducate a 
portion of the existing non-software workforce is one approach to providing a larger software 
engineering workforce. 
This paper presents the findings of recent research performed by the Industry/University 
subgroup of the Working Group on Software Engineering Education and Training into collaborative 
reeducation efforts between industry and academic institutions for converting non-software 
professionals into software engineers. 
1.1 The Working Group on Software Engineering Education and Training 
The Working Group on Software Engineering Education and Training (WGSEET) (http:// 
www.sei.cmu.edu/collaborating/ed/workgroup-ed.html) was formed in 1995 with the mission of 
improving the state of software engineering education and training. An ad hoc group of 
approximately 80 international professionals from academia, industry, and government, the focus of the 
group is on the education and professional development of software practitioners through degree 
programs, continuing education, on-the-job training, etc. The Industry/University (I/U) 
subgroup is a subset of WGSEET members whose focus is to explore and foster collaborations 
between academic institutions and industry [11]. Currently, the I/U group is investigating 
collaborations in which non-software professionals and practitioners without formal software 
education are reeducated to become software engineers. 
Section 2 describes our approach and research framework, while Section 3 discusses the 
characteristics of successful collaborations. Section 4 describes the alumni opinions of the usefulness 
of the knowledge they gained in the collaborative programs, and Section 5 provides some 
general conclusions. 
2. Investigation process 
The motivation for investigating I/U reeducation collaborations occurred as a result of a talk 
given to the WGSEET by Dennis Frailey [6] in March 2000 in which he described a 
collaborative software engineering reeducation program between Texas Instruments/Raytheon and several 
Dallas area universities. Using Beckman's definition [1] of a collaboration as "a formal, joint 
effort by a university (or universities) and a business or government organization(s), where each 
party provides specified products and services to achieve common goals," we decided to focus 
on cooperative programs between academic institutions and industry partners to retrain non-
software professionals to become software engineers. We decided to center our investigation on 
education programs that had a wider effect than several-day or week-long just-in-time training. In 
March 2000 we began our investigation by identifying nine industry-university collaborative 
programs. By February 2001, we had centered our investigation on five ongoing collaborations 
whose programs range in duration from eight months to two years. The outcomes of these 
collaborative programs ranged from students that obtained credit towards undergraduate courses to 
students who received Master's degrees. In the following sections we describe our approach to 
investigating I/U reeducation collaborations. 
2.1 Our approach 
The organization of the major steps taken in our investigation are shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Process used to study I/U reeducation collaborations 
Our investigation process has ten steps: 
Step 1 Determine Collaboration Selection Criteria: We began our efforts in March 2000 by 
identifying a set of criteria that we used to select candidate collaborations. Criteria included 
programs with a focus on education/training for non-software professionals, programs that were 
currently in existence, and ongoing interaction between industrial and academic partners. 
Step 2 Conduct Initial Survey: Based on our selection criteria, we developed a short survey 
that we used to identify candidate collaborations. Between April and June 2000, we distributed 
this survey to a variety of software engineering fora. 
Step 3 Filter Respondent Information: In December 2000 we applied the selection criteria 
to the results of the initial survey to determine collaborations and identified a pool of nine 
successful collaborations, six located in the United States and three located in Europe. Details of 
these results are described in [5]. 
Step 4 Administer Questionnaire: An in-depth questionnaire was constructed in November 
2000, focusing on the organizational and participational factors that may have contributed to the 
success of the collaboration. 
Step 5 Conduct Interviews: During January and February 2001, the questionnaire was 
administered to the candidate collaborations identified in Step 3. 
Step 6 Evaluate Questionnaire Results: During the month of February 2001, the results of 
the questionnaire were tabulated to determine characteristics of successful industry/university 
collaborations. Ellis et al. [2] provide the initial results of the questionnaire, and an overview of 
features of successful collaborations is included in Section 3. 
Step 7 Create Industry Opinion Survey: Results from the questionnaires and interviews 
indicated a possible academic bias in our information. Therefore, in order to elicit industry 
views, we constructed a short industry opinion survey during February 2001. 
Step 8 Incorporate Industry Opinion Results: The industry opinion survey was 
administered to the industry partners participating in the collaborations in April 2001, and during May

Step 9 Conduct Alumni Survey: During October 2001, the I/U subgroup constructed a 
survey to elicit information on the breadth of knowledge gained from the collaboration and its 
usefulness. Survey details are provided in Section 4. 
Step 10 Interpret Alumni Survey Results: In February 2002, the I/U subgroup evaluated 
the results of the alumni survey. While we lacked sufficient responses to obtain statistically 
significant results, we were able to make some useful observations on the transfer of skills, which 
we discuss in Section 4. 
3. Successful collaboration construction and execution 
Based on our observations of the ongoing collaborations over the course of two years, we 
have identified characteristics of successful collaborative efforts to reeducate software 
engineers. A more complete discussion of our observations can be found in [4]. 
3.1 Common characteristics 
Based on our observations, it appears that successful collaborations share factors related to 
industry participation. Common characteristics of the collaborations we studied include: 
Industrial Initiative: A majority of the collaborations were initiated by the industry 
partner(s) as a result of recognizing the need to expand their workforce. 
Strong Industrial Partners: The industry partners in the collaborations are either sizeable 
companies or collections of companies that have significant financial resources, and almost all 
are either government agencies or private companies that handle government contracts. 
Practically Oriented Programs: All of the collaborative programs studied were practically 
oriented, focusing on the application of knowledge and skills. 
Software Practitioners as Students: All of the students who participated in the collaborative 
programs had been employed in some aspect of the software field for two to over ten years. 
Limited Number of Students: The successful collaborations that we examined all had 
between 10 and 25 students per offering. 
3.2 Dissimilar characteristics 
We also identified several differences between the programs including: 
Content Definition for the Program: Content definition alternatives included determination 
by the industry partners, by the university partner, or by a mixed group. 
Admission Procedure: In some collaborations the industry partner selected students or 
dictated student selection, while in others students were required to fulfill the academic institution's 
program entrance requirements. 
Financial Models: In some collaborations the industry partner paid on a per student basis, 
while in others the industry partner provided the academic partner with a specific amount of 
funding, irrespective of the number of students. 
Other minor differences between the programs included location, timing of class offerings, 
and content. 
3.3 Benefits 
In the process of evaluating the collaborations, we identified four benefits that resulted from 
the collaborative reeducation efforts: 
Knowledge Enrichment of University Teachers: Practical knowledge migrated into the 
curriculum as faculty gained increased exposure to real-world software development practices. 
Self-Supporting Programs: All of the collaborations that we studied were entirely self-
supporting and in some instances financially profitable. 
Knowledge Enrichment of Industry Employees: The expanded knowledge and skill set of 
employees is the primary benefit identified by industry partners. 
More Competitive Software Industries: Reeducation collaborations result in a benefit to the 
software industry as a whole through the production of better quality software. 
Other indirect benefits obtained from the collaborative programs are that employees are less 
likely to leave the company when they are participating in a collaborative reeducation program. 
3.4 Industry viewpoint 
In general, the industry partners appeared to be very satisfied with the collaborations and their 
outcome [3]. All of the industry partners indicated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with 
the program development and participant selection. All industry partners thought that the 
program management and oversight, student enrollment procedure, and format, content, and pace of 
the program were acceptable. The majority of the industry respondents rated both the 
instructors' knowledge and the facilities as outstanding, while the instructors' teaching skills were rated 
sufficient by most respondents. All of the respondents indicated that they felt that the number of 
participants in the program was the correct size. All of the industry partners indicated that they 
felt that the program was successful and that they gained knowledgeable, competent employees. 
The main area for improvement identified by industry partners was the incorporation of 
domain knowledge in program content. 
4. Evaluating knowledge/skill transfer 
In October 2001, the I/U subgroup decided to try to assess the efficacy and efficiency of 
knowledge and skill transfer that occurs in the collaborative reeducation programs (Figure 1 
steps 9-10). We constructed a survey to educe the opinions of alumni of the collaborative 
programs in which they participated. The first part of the survey asked students the emphasis placed 
on each of the subjects, the usefulness of the knowledge acquired in each subject for alumni's 
current job tasks, and the sufficiency of knowledge gained for each subject using the ten major 
SWEBOK topics [9]. The second focus area of the surveys dealt with the impact of the programs 
on the professional and educational status of the alumni. In this section, we describe our effort 
and the results. 
4.2. Results analysis 
Alumni of four different collaborations were surveyed to analyze knowledge transfer in their 
collaborations. A total of 31 surveys for the four collaborations were collected. Two 
collaborations were located in Spain (Madrid) and two in the United States (Georgia, Pennsylvania). 
Although the final number of surveys is insufficient for a formal statistical analysis, the survey 
results allow us to make some general observations about the efficacy of the programs. 
In order to understand how the alumni's current jobs were impacted by their education, we 
surveyed alumni to determine the software engineering activities performed in their current 
positions. Table 1 shows the activities performed by the alumni. Note that the percentage column 
does not add up to 100, as some alumni performed more than one activity type. 
4.2.1. Results of content measurement: A set of emphasis, usefulness and sufficiency of 
knowledge gradients were used to ascertain alumni opinions on the skills gained from their 
educational experience. Figure 2 shows the results for all 31 alumni for the part of our survey based 
on these gradients. Overall, practitioners who participated in the collaborative programs have a 
positive impression of the effectiveness and usefulness of the skills that they gained. These 
results differ somewhat from Lethbridge's study on the applicability of software engineering 
knowledge [10], which indicates a larger gap between transferred knowledge and its usefulness 
in industry. One reason for this difference could be the fact that the majority of the collaborative 
efforts we investigated involved postgraduate (Master's level) education, which is typically 
more focused than undergraduate education. 
Figure 2 indicates that alumni consider the knowledge acquired about the topics of software 
management and software requirements most useful, whereas the knowledge related to software 
construction, software testing, and software maintenance is somewhat less useful. Since Table 1 
Indicates that a higher percentage of alumni perform project and requirements management 
tasks, this is not an unexpected result. The results for the topics of testing and maintenance 
indicate that alumni do not consider the knowledge acquired on these topics to be very useful. 
Figure 2. Weighted values of emphasis, usefulness, and sufficiency of knowledge 
The ideal result would be for all three measures (emphasis, usefulness, and sufficiency) to be 
equal for each subject. An analysis of the chart in Figure 2 shows that the average pair-wise cor-

relation for the three characteristics is .79 between usefulness and sufficiency of knowledge, .78 
between emphasis and usefulness, and .89 between emphasis and sufficiency of knowledge. 
The relationship between usefulness and sufficiency of knowledge indicates the effectiveness 
of the programs. Figure 2 shows that except for software management, the knowledge 
sufficiency for each subject is at least as great as the usefulness, indicating that the programs are 
viewed as very effective. For software management, the emphasis rating is slightly lower than 
the usefulness rating, which may indicate a need for programs to reexamine content related to 
software management, as well as to review the process by which this topic is taught. 
Overall, the .79 correlation between usefulness and sufficiency of knowledge shows that 
alumni are satisfied with the knowledge gained from the collaboration. A large difference 
between the sufficiency of knowledge rating and a greater usefulness rating, as seen in the 
software tools/methods and software design areas, indicates that programs are providing more 
knowledge or skills than required by the alumni. Since only 25% of alumni perform design tasks 
(see Table 1), alumni may benefit from education and skills at a higher level of abstraction. 
The relationship between content emphasis and the sufficiency of knowledge determines the 
efficiency of the education. The .89 correlation between these two characteristics indicates a 
relatively efficient transfer of skills. The largest differences are found for software quality and 
software configuration management; alumni believe that these topics receive more emphasis than 
their usefulness warrants. The results for software testing show that the sufficiency of 
knowledge rating is higher than the level of emphasis. 
The relationship between content emphasis and knowledge usefulness can provide an 
indication of the overall success of the collaboration. The relatively high correlation of .78 indicates 
that the reeducation programs are producing individuals that, from the alumni point of view, are 
highly qualified to step into software engineering positions. 
4.2.2. Results of subjective assessment: The second part of the survey asked alumni to 
assess the program's effect on the educational and professional status of the alumni by indicating 
the extent they agreed (strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree) with statements: 
My software engineering education has adequately prepared me for my current job. 
My education provided me with knowledge and skills that contribute to my job performance. 
My education has improved my software development skills. 
My education has improved my communication skills. 
My education has improved my technical skills. 
My education has improved my organizational skills. 
My education was highly relevant to state-of-the-art practices in my field. 
My education provided me with a useful reputation as a software engineer. 
My education contributed to the development of my professional career. 
I would recommend participation in my educational program to others. 
The results indicate that the alumni generally agree that the programs improved their skills, 
with 70% of alumni stating that the programs improved their technical skills and almost 90% of 
alumni indicating that they would recommend the program to colleagues. 
Although a majority of the alumni stated that management supported the use of the newly 
acquired knowledge and skills, 25% of alumni indicated that they received no such assistance. 
Another unexpected result of the subjective assessment was that alumni have a relatively low 
perception of the reputation that they received as a result of their educational experience. One 
possible reason for this result is that most of the alumni surveyed were within two years or less 
of their graduation and the impact of the reputation may not be felt until later in their careers. 
5. Conclusion 
In the course of its two-year investigation into industry/university collaborations to reeducate 
non-software personnel to become software engineers, the I/U subgroup of the WGSEET has 
compiled several useful observations about such collaborations. The primary observation is that 
these collaborations provide significant benefits for all three major stakeholders: the industry 
partner, the academic partner, and the students. Industry feedback indicates that companies 
benefit from a larger, more highly trained workforce with a higher level of knowledge and skills 
while retaining large stores of domain knowledge held by the existing employees. Universities 
benefit from increased visibility of their programs, as well as from the dissemination of a real- 
world vision of software engineering throughout the faculty. Students benefit by becoming more 
highly skilled workers, with higher job satisfaction and more career mobility. 
One area of concern that we identified in our investigation was the apparent relatively short 
life of industry/university collaborations for reeducating software engineers. Given the amount 
of effort required to construct such a program and the continuing shortfall of qualified software 
engineers, we believe that maintaining these programs is of value to both the partners involved, 
as well as to the larger discipline of software engineering.
