    <body>1 Introduction 
Recently, mathematical techniques for non-perturbative way to analyze models in quantum 
electrodynamics (QED) are developing gradually. In the development, we face some cases so that we cannot analyze 
the ground state energy of models in QED by the regular perturbation theory [LL, Hi, HS]. Especially, 
Lieb and Loss showed in [LL, Theorem 1.1] the curious results on the upper and lower estimates of the 
ground state energy of so-called Pauli-Fierz model describing electrons interacting with the radiation field. 
Their result means that the renormalized mass of the model cannot be calculated by the perturbation 
theory not only in the case of large coupling length but also small one. They showed that the order in 
the coupling length is less than the order of the square derived by the regular perturbation theory. Its 
physical reason has not clarified yet to author's best knowledge. Moreover, Griesemer, Lieb, and Loss 
showed in [GLL] that the Pauli-Fierz model has a ground state for all values of the coupling length. Thus, 
their results mean that the Pauli-Fierz model has a non-perturbative ground state for the all coupling 
length. Considering the history of physics, we should have succeeded in the mass renormalization for 
non-relativistic treatment by Pauli and Fierz. What on physics may have happened to the Pauli-Fierz 
model? We are much interested in the physical reason for the existence of such a ground state refusing 
the perturbation theory, and also we are interested in the influence on the renormalizable field theory. 
On the other hand, for the Weisskopf-Wigner (WW) model (i.e., the Dicke model in the rotating 
wave approximation), we know that a non-perturbative ground state appears in the case with the large 
coupling length [Hi], and the ground state energy is so low that the regular perturbation theory cannot 
give it. Here WW model describes a two level system coupled with a Bose field, and it was actively 
argued as a simple version of the Lee model [Le], the Dicke model for superradiance [Di], a simple model 
of spin-photon model of quantum optics and NMR, and the model describing the elementary process of 
the decay from neutron to proton and 
#- -meson. And also it is to argue the spontaneous emission in 
the Weisskopf-Wigner theory [WW]. For the emission and absorption of photons between the two-level 
system, we face the difficulty of the resonance scattering in the regular perturbation theory. So, the 
Weisskopf-Wigner theory is for the higher order revision for the regular perturbation theory, and WW 
model has the effect of this revision. Then, the ground state energy with the order in the coupling length 
is less than the order of square coming from the regular perturbation theory. For WW model this order 
less than the order of square is available even for the sufficiently small coupling length i.e., in the region 
of the perturbation theory. But in [Hi, Lemma 2.2] we knew that growing the coupling length restore the 
same order as the regular perturbation theory. 
As mentioned above the WW model is a simplification of the Lee model, and moreover the Lee 
model can be decomposed into a direct sum of the Hamiltonian H 1 equivalent to WW model and a free 
Hamiltonian H 2 (see (2.4) below), so we can expect that Lee model has the similar non-perturbative 
ground state in the case with the large coupling length. Moreover, it is well known that, for the Lee 
model, renormalizations with perturbative way and non-perturbative way imply the same result. Thus, 
in this paper, we reconsider the Lee model in the light of the renormalizable field theory in the early 
stage and quantum optics for the case including the large coupling length. More precisely, we return 
to the early stage of the renormalizable field theory developed by Lee, Klln, and Pauli, and we show 
the limit of the successful result of renormalizations with perturbative and non-perturbative ways. We 
show also the existence of a non-perturbative ground state when we are beyond perturbation theory. As 
for the ground state energy of the Lee model, as well as WW model, the ground state energy for the 
small coupling length has the order less than that of square because of the higher order revision for the 
regular perturbation theory following the Weisskopf-Wigner theory. But the non-perturbative ground 
1 
state energy recovers the order of the square, which is the same order as that by regular perturbation 
theory, in the coupling length when the Lee model is outside the region of the regular perturbation theory. 
We investigate the behavior of the ground state energy with the Jaynes-Cummings model [Mi, 6.4] in 
quantum optics. 
As to such a low energy of the non-perturbative ground state beyond the regular perturbation theory, 
a similar non-perturbative ground state is shown in physics by Preparata [Pr90, Pr95] and Enz [En]. 
It is called superradiant ground state from the point of view of superradiance of soft photons. The 
superradiance was, of course, found by Dicke in [Di]. Its existence is proved with the path-integral 
method by Preparata, and with another manner by Enz. But it has not yet been clarified whether 
the ground state showed in [Hi] is superradiant or not. By the way, in [Hi] we had adhered to the 
coupling length. But, following the recent result [Bi01] by Billionnet, we should consider the condition of 
physical parameter B g,which represents a relation of the coupling length and an infrared or ultraviolet 
singularity condition. We apply the same method as [Hi] to a special Lee Model and prove there also 
exists the similar non-perturbative ground state being still in the standard state space. Thus, we show 
that the non-perturbative ground state is stable, and moreover the ground state energy is also lower than 
the normal renormalized mass showed in [Le] by Lee. 
In Lee's renormalization argument, there is the possibility that such a ground state becomes a ghost. 
Actually, Lee noted briefly in [Le, footnote 4] the existence of another state from the state with the 
normal renormalized mass. And moreover, in the process of developing the renormalizable field theory, 
Kalln and Pauli investigated precisely in [KP] the existence of another state than the normal state, 
and they showed concrete form of the state and it has lower energy than the normal renormalized mass. 
But we cannot understand their extra ground state in the standard Hilbert space theory because it has 
negative `norm' coming from complex renormalization constant. We are interested in the relation among 
the states which we show in this paper, Preparata found, and Lee, Klln and Pauli found. 
For a while, let us review Lee's renormalization argument [Le], Klln and Pauli's [KP] renormalization 
argument, and the Weisskopf-Wigner model [Hi]. 
1.1 Lee's Renormalization Argument 
The Lee model describes the interacting system between two neutral fermion fields V and N and a 
neutral scalar boson field #. In this paper, we use the natural units, ~ = c = 1. Let   V ,   + V 
and 
  N ,   + N 
be annihilation and creation operators of V -particle and N-particle, respectively, and let # # , # + # 
be annihilation and creation operators of #-particle, respectively. Then, the Hamiltonian of the Lee model 
is given by 
H := H 0 + gH I , (1.1) 
H 0 := m V 
Z R d 
d d p   + V 
(p)   V 
(p) + m N 
Z R d 
d d p   + N 
(p)   N 
(p) 
+ Z R d 
d d k !(k)# + # 
(k)# # 
(k) (1.2) 
H I := Z R d 
R d 
d d pd d k 
# (! (k)) 
p 2! (k)   + V 
(p)   N 
(p - k) # # 
(k) 
+  V 
(p)   + N 
(p - k) # + # 
(k) # , (1.3) 
where !(k) gives the dispersion relation defined by !(k) := p k 2 + 2 (# 0), and m V } 0, m N } 0, and 
# 0 are bare masses of V -particle, N-particle, and #-particle, respectively. And g is the bare coupling 
constant, # is introduced as a cutoff function of energy. We note that the following: although V -particle 
and N-particle have momenta, they do not have kinetic energies. Thus, we here understand that the 
masses m V 
and m N 
are so heavy that we can ignore the kinetic energies. 
The interaction Hamiltonian H I represents the reaction 
V # N + #. (1.4) 
Namely, a V -particle emits a #-particle, and changes into an N-particle. On the other side, an N-particle 
absorbs a #-particle, and changes into a V -particle. Moreover, m V 
has a renormalization because of the 
process of V ! N + # ! V , and the process of N + # ! V ! N + # means the scattering of #-particle 
2 
by N-particle. Thus, the physical system described by H possesses two conservation laws: 
N V 
+ N N 
= constant, (1.5) 
N V 
+ N # 
= constant, (1.6) 
where N V 
, N N 
, and N # 
are the total number of V -particles, N-particles, and #-particles, respectively. 
Because of these conservation laws (1.5) and (1.6), the eigenstate of H contains only a finite number of 
particles. So, the eigenstate can be solved directly, and Lee performed that in [Le]. 
Let |V (p)i and |N (p)i be the state of the bare V -particle and N-particle, respectively. We denote the 
state of the corresponding physical particles by |V(p)i and |N(p)i. Then, by (1.4), (1.5), and (1.6), we 
have 
|N(p)i = |N (p)i, (1.7) 
|V(p)i := Z 1/2 
V 
# |V (p)i + g Z R d 
d d k f (k) # + # 
(k)|N (p - k)i # , (1.8) 
where Z 1/2 
V 
is a normalization constant, and the function, f(k), is determined latter for an ultraviolet 
cutoff. 
We now follow the theory of renormalization by the power series method [Dy, Sa, Wa] in the 
perturbative way. We denote the renormalized mass of V -particle, renormalized constant of wave function, and 
renormalized coupling constant by m c , Z 2 , and g c . Then, as Lee proved in [Le], the self-energy is given 
by 
#(p 0 ) = g 2 Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
(p 
0- m N - ! (k)) , (1.9) 
where p 0 
is- i times the fourth component p 4 of the momentum vector p, i.e., p 0 = - ip 4 . So, the 
renormalized constant Z 2 is given by Z - 1 
2 # Z - 1 
2 (m c ) = d#(p 0 )/dp 0 at p 0 = m c on the mass shell 
p 2 +m 2 
c = 0. Namely, 
Z - 1 
2 # Z - 1 
2 (m c ) = 1 + g 2 Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
(m c - m N - ! (k)) 2 . (1.10) 
Following the way by [Sa], we put 
g 2 
c := Z 2 g 2 . (1.11) 
Then, by (1.10) we have 
g 2 = g 2 
c 
( 1 - g 2 
c Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
(m c - m N - ! (k)) 2 
) - 1 
, (1.12) 
Z 2 = 1 - g 2 
c Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
(m c - m N - ! (k)) 2 
(1.13) 
as shown in [Le, (26), (27)]. Thus, g and Z 2 are dependent of m c , g c , and #, i.e., g = g(m c , g c , #), 
Z 2 = Z 2 (m c , g c , #). Then, following the primal policy of renormalization, we insert observed values into 
m c and g c respectively, and Z 2 has to be finite as # ! 1 for the fixed m c and g c . Then, when we regard 
m c and g c as independent variables, we can define a function, Z ren 
2 (m c , g c , #), from Z 2 , i.e., 
Z ren 
2 (m c , g c , #) is defined by (1.13) for independent variables, m c , g c 2 R (1.14) 
Since the physical meaning of Z ren 
2 is the probability of existence of a state, we have to avoid a ghost 
(Z ren 
2 &lt; 0). Thus, we cannot take such a limit freely, and we have to keep (m c , g c , #) really so that Z ren 
2 
can be between 0 and 1 (see the conclusion of [KP]). This is one of Lee's statements in [Le, KP] as to 
the non-unitary-equivalence between the bare particle states and physical particle states. Set 
g crit := ( Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
(m c - m N - ! (k)) 2 
) - 1/2 
. (1.15) 
3 
Then, 
Z ren 
2 = 
1- g 2 
c 
g 2 
crit 
. (1.16) 
And the renormalized coupling constant, g c , has to satisfy |g c | # g crit to Z ren 
2 lies between zero and one. 
On the other hand, we have 
g c = g ( 1 + g 2 Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
(m c - m N - ! (k)) 2 
)- 1 
. (1.17) 
So, when we regard g and m c as independent variables, we can define a function, g ren 
c , from g c , i.e., 
g ren 
c (m c , g, #) is defined by (1.17) for independent variables m c , g 2 R. (1.18) 
So, it is important to check the normal zone, Gmc ,# , which is given by the range of the function, g c (g) = 
g c (m c , g, #), of g 2 R for fixed m c and # arbitrarily, i.e., Gmc ,# := {g c (m c , g, #) | - 1 &lt; g &lt; 1}. Because, 
if the observed coupling constant, g obs , is more than g " (g, #) := sup g g c (m c , g, #) (i.e., g obs } g " (g, #)), 
we cannot take g c as g c = g obs . For the fixed m c , by (1.17) 
|g c | # ( 4 Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
(m c - m N - ! (k)) 2 
) - 1/2 
, (1.19) 
g c ! 0 as |g| !1. (1.20) 
Thus, |g c | &lt; g crit now. 
On the other hand, for the Lee model we can determine m c independently of the perturbative way. 
As we did in [AH00, 6.2] and [Hi, (2.11)] we introduce a function, D(z; #), of z by 
D(z; #) 
:=- z +m V - # 2 Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
!(k) + m N - z 
(1.21) 
defined for all z 2 C and every # 2 R such that |# (! (k)) | 2 /! (k) |z - m N - !(k)| is Lebesgue integrable 
on R d . In the same way as [AH00, 6.2], D(z; #) is defined in the cut plane Cm N 
,:= C \ [ m N 
+ , 1) , 
# 0, and analytic there. It is easy to see that D(x; #) is monotone decreasing in x &lt; m N 
+ . Hence, 
the limit d(#) := lim x"m N 
+D(x; #) exists, and 
d(#) = - - m N 
+ m V - # 2 lim 
t#0 
Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
!(k) - m N - + t 
. (1.22) 
In the case of d(g) &lt; 0, D(z; g) = 0 has a solution, z = m Vc 
. Thus, by this solution, m Vc 
, and (1.8), 
we know that 
|V(p)i = Z 1/2 
Vc 
( |V (p)i + g Z R d 
d d k 
# (! (k)) 
p 2! (k) 
1 
m Vc - m N - ! (k) # + (k)|N (p - k)i ) (1.23) 
is an eigenstate of H with H |V(p)i = m Vc |V(p)i, where we took Z V 
as Z V 
= Z Vc # Z 2 (m Vc 
). Therefore, 
a candidate for m c is m Vc 
, i.e., m c = m Vc 
. Moreover, 
m Vc &lt; m N 
+ (1.24) 
for every |g| satisfying D(0; g) &lt; 0. 
By the way, using the fact that scattering state satisfies the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, it is known 
that the scattering amplitude is given by 
g 2 
Vc 
# (! (k)) 
p 2! (k) 
# (! (k 0 )) 
p 2! (k 0 ) #(p + k - p 0 - k 0 ) 1 
m N 
+ ! (k) - m Vc 
( 1 - g 2 
Vc 
Z R d 
d d k 0 |# (! (k 0 )) | 2 
2! (k 0 ) 
m N 
+ ! (k) - m Vc 
(! (k) - ! (k 0 ) + i#) m Vc - m N - ! (k 0 ) # 2 
) - 1 
(1.25) 
4 
(e.g., see [Ta, (53)]), where p and k denote the momenta of scattering state of N-particle and #-particle 
respectively, p 0 and k 0 are those of N-particle and #-particle coming into a detector respectively, and 
moreover g 2 
Vc 
:= Z Vc g 2 , i# (# } 0) comes from the adiabatic factor in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, 
and i# means the outgoing plane wave. Thus, since differential cross-section is given by the square of the 
absolute value of the scattering amplitude, (1.24) means that 
V -particle is stable for every g with D(0; g) &lt; 0, i.e., (1.26) 
V -particles do not decay into N-particles and #-particles spontaneously beyond (1.24) because (1.5) holds 
and the resonance scattering hardly occurs since ! (k 0 ) # } m Vc - m N 
, which comes from all higher 
order revisions 
N + # ! V ! N + # ! V ! N + # ! 
for the regular perturbation theory following the Weisskopf-Wigner theory. On the other hand, even if 
m N &lt; m V 
first, we have (1.24) as long as the coupling constant g satisfies D(0; g) &lt; 0. Thus, in the 
process from m N &lt; m V 
to (1.24), 
N-particle is unstable for every g satisfying D(0; g) &lt; 0, i.e., (1.27) 
N-particles decay into V -particles by absorbing #-particles. 
1.2 Klln and Pauli's Renormalization Argument 
In this subsection, we review Klln and Pauli's renormalization argument in [KP] in terms of our 
situation. 
We set 
m V 
= m N 
= m } 0, (1.28) 
#m := m Vc - m. (1.29) 
Then, by (1.11), (1.13), and (1.22) we know that z = m Vc 
is a solution of 
D(z; g) = - z +m - #m - 
g 2 
c 
2Z 2 
Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
! (k) 
1 
! (k) - z - m Vc 
+ #m # = 0. 
(1.30) 
Kalln and Pauli derived 
h(z - m Vc 
) 
:= z - m Vc # " 1 + g 2 
c 
2 Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
! (k) 
z - m Vc 
(! (k) - #m) 2 ! (k) - #m - z - m Vc fiff # 
= 0. (1.31) 
from (1.30) by using (1.29) and (1.16) in [KP]. Of course, z = m Vc 
is a solution of (1.31), but Klln and 
Pauli found that there exists another solution z = #KP , living on the real axis with #KP &lt; m Vc 
[KP, II 
and Appendix I]. And, they gave the concrete form of the state with energy #KP as 
|VKP (p)i = 1 
p |h 0 (#KP )| 
( Z ren 1/2 
Vc |V (p)i + g c Z R d 
d d k 
# (! (k)) 
p 2! (k) 

1 
! (k) - #KP - #m 
# + (k)|N (p - k)i # , 
where |VKP (p)i has not yet been normalized. Then, the normalization becomes negative because Z ren 
Vc 
makes a ghost (i.e., Z ren 2 
Vc 
&lt; 0) for so large coupling as to exist the solution. Here we regarded Z Vc 
as the 
function Z ren 
Vc 
of independent variables m Vc 
, g c running over R respectively, and # in the sense of (1.14). 
So, such a mathematically strange situation occurs. In order to cope with this trouble, they introduced 
an indefinite metric in the Hilbert space [KP, III].

1.3 Wigner-Weisskopf Model 
In this subsection, we review and modify the results on the Weisskopf-Wigner model in [Hi] to apply 
them to physics of #-meson. 
Nuclear force is the first example with the strong interaction between elementary particles. The 
coupling length of the interaction between baryon and meson is in the region from 0.1 to 10, and it 
is very large as compared with 1/137, that of quantum electrodynamics. As is well known, nuclear 
force connects nucleus and nucleon. Nucleon is a generic name of proton (p) and neutron (n), and is 
constructed by u-quark and d-quark. The particle taking a job of nuclear force is #-meson. Physics 
for #-meson was investigated actively in 1940s and 1950s (see [HT]). On the other hand, as mentioned 
in introduction, mathematics for the non-perturbative treatment of models with large coupling length 
which physicists once argued such as #-meson is recently and gradually established. In this subsection, 
by applying mathematical techniques developed recently to the theory of #-meson, we argue rigorously 
existence and nonexistence of state in the elementary process of n # p + 
#- for each total charge Q and 
all coupling length g. Here `state' means that eigenvector of the Hamiltonian for our model is still alive 
in the Hilbert space representing the statespace. 
The model with the interaction between #-meson and nucleon considering all elementary processes, 
p # p + # 0 , p # n + # + , and n # p + # - , is described by the following Hamiltonian (see [HT]): 
H = H 0 + H 0 , (1.32) 
H 0 = X 
`,m,# 
Z 1 
0 
d 3 k !(k)a + #m 
` (k)a #m 
` (k), (1.33) 
H 0 = f 
X m# 
Z 1 
0 
d 3 k k 2 
(12# 2 !(k)) 1/2 #(k)# ##m n a #m 
1 (k) + a + #m 
` (k) o , (1.34) 
where # # and #m are the standard #-matrices and Pauli's #-matrices. 
We now assume !(k) = p k 2 +m 2 , where m is the mass of #-meson. We set 
H#m = Z 1 
0 
d 3 k !(k)a + #m 
` 
(k)a #m 
` (k) + f 

Z 1 
0 
d 3 k k 2 
(12# 2 !(k)) 1/2 #(k)# ##m n a #m 
1 (k) + a + #m 
` 
(k) o . 
Then, regarding H # F # , A and B j in [AH97, (1.6)] as C 2 
# C 2 
# F # , 0 and # ##m , respectively, where 
F # is the boson Fock space representing the state space for #-meson, we know that H#m is an example 
of the generalized spin-boson model we called in [AH97]. By [AH97, Theorem 1.2 and Remark 1.2], H#m 
has a ground state, which implied that if #(k) is continuous, and R R 3 d 3 k k 4 #(k) 2 &lt; 1, then there is a 
ground state for H . 
Unfortunately, the only thing we can say for H now is the above assertion with the estimates of the 
ground state energy in [AH97, Proposition 1.4], and we do not have physical properties for H . In order 
to argue physical properties for #-meson more precisely in this paper, we treat the elementary process 
n # p + # - without p # p + # 0 and p # n + # + from now on. 
We express nucleon coupling #-meson by |p) and |n) as |p) = # 1 
0 # # # and |n) = # 0 
1 # # # be the 
bare state of proton and neutron respectively, where # # is the vacuum of #-meson. Set 
# + = # 0 1 
0 0 # , # - = # 0 0 
1 0 # , # 3 = # 1 0 
0 - 1 # . (1.35) 
Thus, the operation of # and # 3 acting on nucleon are 
# - |p) = |n) # - |n) = 0, 
# + |n) = |p) # - |p) = 0, (1.36) 
# 3 |p) = |p) # 3 |n) = -  n). 
Then, following [HT], we employ the interaction which occurs n # p + # - with the form, 
(# + ) (creation operator of # - -meson) + (# - ) (annihilation operator of # - -meson). 
6 
So, the Hamiltonian describing the process, n # p + 
#- , is given by 
H 
#- = H # - ,0 + H 0 # - , (1.37) 
H # - ,0 = 
1- # 3 
2 E 0 + Z R 3 
d 3 k !(k)a + (k)a(k) (1.38) 
H 0 
# - = g Z R 3 
d 3 k #(k) # # - a(k) + # +a + (k) # , (1.39) 
where a(k) and a + (k) are the annihilation and creation operators respectively with 
# a(k) , a + (k 0 ) # = #(k - k 0 ), (1.40) 
[a(k) , a(k 0 )] = # a + (k) , a + (k 0 ) # = 0, (1.41) 
and E 0 denotes the difference of masses between proton and neutron. The dispersion relation between 
the energy and momentum is denoted by !(k). In the case of non-relativistic energy, !(k) is given 
as !(k) = m + k 2 
m 
as in [HT]. But this dispersion relation does not make a sense for so high energy. 
To consider the case of higher energy, we set !(k) = p k 2 + m 2 in the case of relativistic energy as in 
[Le]. For a ultraviolet cutoff function #(k), Henley and Thirring set #(k) = #(k) in [HT] because they 
treated boson as non-relativistic. On the other hand, Lee set #(k) = # (! (k)) / p 2!(k) in [Le] because 
he treated boson as relativistic. We assume that #(k) is positive, continuous, spherically symmetric and 
R R 3 d 3 k #(k) 2 &lt; 1. Then, the state space for H # - as a Hilbert space F is given by F = C 2 
# F # . And, 
we get 
H # - ,0 |p) = 0 and H # - ,0 |n) = E 0 |n). (1.42) 
Moreover, the physical state |pi of proton is same as its bare state, i.e., |pi = |p), so we have 
H # - |pi = 0. (1.43) 
The point eigenvalues # p (H # - ,0 ) of H # - ,0 are 0 and E 0 , i.e., # p (H # - ,0 ) = {0, E 0 }. 
We note here that H # - is the same Hamiltonian as in [Hi, (2.10)]. Thus, for the Pauli matrix 
# 1 = # 0 1 
1 0 # , we have that # 1 H # - # 1 is the Wigner-Weisskopf Hamiltonian called in [Hi, (2.4)] or the 
spin-boson Hamiltonian with the rotating wave approximation called in [HS, 6]. 
The total charge Q is given by 
Q = 1 
2 # 3 - Z R 3 
d 3 k a + (k)a(k). (1.44) 
Then, H # - conserves the total charge, [H # - , Q] = 0. Therefore, H # - can be written as the direct sum 
of HQ=- (2# - 1)/2 's (# = 0, 1, 2, ), where HQ=- (2# - 1)/2 is the restricted H # - on the space of all states 
with Q = - (2# - 1)/2. We note here that 1 
2 - U # 
1 QU 1 is written by NP in [HS, (6.2)] and [Hi, (2.17)] as 
the total number operator. 
It is easy to check the states with Q = 1 
2 
, but it is well-known that it is difficult to show that 
existence of states with Q = - N 
2 for large odd number N as Henley and Thirring wrote in their text 
book [HT]. In this subsection, we prove that the existence of a state with Q = - 2(# - 1) 
2 
for N 3 # # 2, 
and argue when the state appears. We know that the appearance is not standard one. 
Here we introduce a physical parameter B g,m consisting of the coupling length and the self-energy of 
boson part as follows: 
B g,m := Z R 3 
d 3 k B g,m (k), B g,m (k) := g 2 # 2 (k) 
! (k) , (1.45) 
which is a modification of the parameter introduced in [Bi01] by Billionnet. The importance of # 2 (k)/!(k) 
was also pointed out in [AE, IV.A]. And, in the same way as (1.21), we introduce a function D(z; g) of z 
by 
D(z; g) 
:=- z + 0 - g 2 Z R 3 
d 3 k |# (k) | 2 
!(k) - z 
. (1.46) 
7 
And also, we obtain a parameter as the limit dm (g) := lim x"m D(x; g) because it exists. For fixed mass 
m, the parameter dm (g) becomes negative, dm (g) &lt; 0, when |g| grows. 
We treat now the case of m } 0, then the existence of the ground state comes from [AH97, Theorem 
1.2]. In the case of m = 0, the existence is due to Grard's work [G], which is explained in Section 2. 
We denote the ground state and ground state energy by |# grd i and E grd , respectively: 
H 
#- |# grd i = E grd |# grd i. (1.47) 
To restrain a state from appearing for NP # 2, we define a differential operator DHS by 
DHS := 1 
2 # 1 
|r k !| 2 r k ! r k + r k r k ! 
1 
|r k !| 2 
# . (1.48) 
The operator DHS was introduced by Hbner and Spohn in [HS, (2.9)] to apply the Mourre estimate, 
and it is called conjugate operator by mathematicians. 
Our !(k) and #(k) satisfy the assumptions [HS, (A.1) &amp; (A.2)]. If D(z; g) = 0 has a solution, then 
we can make a state with Q = - 1 
2 
. But, under dm (g) # 0, since it menas [HS, (6.3)], we cannot make 
any state with Q = - 1 
2 
as Hbner and Spohn mentioned after [HS, (6.3)]. Thus, with the result in [HS, 
Proposition 15], we obtain the following: 
[Q = - 1 
2 
] Suppose that 
g 2 Z R 3 
d 3 k |DHS#(k)| 2 &lt; 1 and Z R 3 
d 3 k |D 2 
HS #(k)| 2 &lt; 1. (1.49) 
Then, state with Q = 1 
2 
exists for all g with dm (g) # 0, and it is |p) of which energy is 0. There is no state 
with Q = - 2# - 1 
2 
for # 2 N. Moreover, the essential spectra of H # - is given as # ess (H # - ) = [m , 1). 
Here `essential spectra' means all continuous energy levels and point energies of infinitely degenerated 
eigenstates. All the results about essential spectra in this paper are due to [Ar00]. In the case of m = 0, 
we can use Skibsted's results instead of Hbner and Spohn's, which is explained in Section 2. 
But, if dm (g) &lt; 0, then the condition [HS, (6.3)] breaks. Namely, D(z; g) = 0 has a real solution, 
z = E c . So we can make an eigenvector with E c as its eigenvalue. Namely, the physical state of neutron 
|ni is given by 
|ni = Z 1/2 
c # # - + g Z R 3 
d 3 k 
# (k) 
E c - ! (k) a + (k) # |p) (1.50) 
with H # - |ni = E c |ni, where Z c is the normalization. Then, 
E c &lt; m for every |g| satisfying D(0; g) &lt; 0, (1.51) 
which means that as to E c the decay from neutron to proton and # - -meson is stable. E c does not have 
the same order in the coupling length as g 2 following from the regular perturbation theory. We have that 
E c # g s Z d 3 k |# (k) | 2 as g !1, (1.52) 
where we note that the term with the order g vanishes in the regular perturbation theory. 
Since HQ=- 1/2 has a state, this is the different result from the result which Hbner and Spohn 
mentioned after [HS, (6.3)] and before [HS, Proposition 15]. But, if we assume the hypotheses in [HS, 
Prosoition 15], then all HQ=- (2# - 1)/2 (N 3 # # 2) have no state by [HS, Prosoition 15]. 
The following condition is to avoid the # decay in the meaning of the remark mentioned by Henley 
and Thirring for n # p + # - in [HT]: 
(Anti #) The function |#(k)| 2 
|x - !(k)| 
is not Lebesgue integrable for all x 2 (m , 1). 
And set 
M g := Z R 3 
d 3 k #(k) 2 
{!(k) - 0 + B g,m } - 1 
. (1.53) 
Then, we obtain the following (see [Hi, Theorem 2.1]): 
[Q = 1 
2 
] Assume (Anti #) and (1.49). Then, for all g with dm (g) &lt; 0 
8 
(i) State with Q 
=- 1 
2 
exists, and it is |ni of which energy is E c . 
(ii) State with Q = 1 
2 
exists, and it is |p) of which energy is 0. 
(iii) There is no state with Q 
=2#- 1 
2 for N 3 # # 2. 
(iv) 
If B g,m &lt; E 0 , then |p) is a unique ground state and |ni a unique excited state. 
If B g,m = E 0 , then |p) and |ni are 2-fold degenerate ground states. 
If B g,m } E 0 and 
2m - E 0 } B 
g,m- g 2 M g + M - 1 
g Z R 3 
d 3 k #(k) 2 , 
then |ni is a unique ground state and |p) a unique excited state. Moreover, the essential spectra of 
H 
#- is given as # ess (H # - ) = [min {0 , E c } + m , 1 ) 
The hypotheses in the above statement requires that B g,m is not so large. 
Avron and Elgart argued the complex solution in the lower half plane of the analytic continuation of 
D(z; g) = 0, which is called `resonance pole' by mathematicians, associated with the state with Q = - 1 
2 
[AE, APPENDIX]. On the other hand, without (Anti #) there is also a possibility of the # decay in the 
meaning of the remark mentioned by Henley and Thirring [HT] for n # p + # - . Consider the following 
fiff (k) instead of #(k) so that fiff (k) breaks (Anti #): 
#(k) = 0 for |k| # # with a constant # } 0. (1.54) 
Let (#) := sup 
|k|## !(k). Suppose that 
lim 
x#(#) 
Z |k|## 
d 3 k |#(k)| 2 
|x - !(k)| 
= +1. (1.55) 
Then, D(x; g) restricted in x 2 ((#) , 1) has a unique simple zero E 0 c in ((#) , 1), which means that 
the neutron becomes unstable for the decay into proton and #-meson. Thus, we have another physical 
state |n 0 i given by 
|n 0 i = Z 0 
c 
1/2 # # - + g Z d 3 k # (k) 
E 0 c - ! (k) a + (k) # |p), (1.56) 
and it is the resonance state caused by the scattering between proton and #-meson. The state |n 0 i is 
also an eigenstate of H # - with H # - |n 0 i = E 0 c |n 0 i, where Z 0 
c is the normalization (see [AH00, Remark6.4] 
and [Bi98]). Therefore, in the same way as the previous result we have the following result, which is a 
rigorous proof of the statement in [HT] on the # decay for Q = - 1 
2 
: 
[# Decay for Q = - 1 
2 
] If (1.54), (1.55), and (1.49) hold, then, concerning the state with Q = - 1 
2 
, 
the two physical states of neutron always exist, and they are |ni and |n 0 i. There is no state besides 
|p), |ni, and |n 0 i. The situation about the switch between the ground state and excited state is same as 
previous result about Q = - 1 
2 
. 
We can prove that, for sufficiently large B g,m (i.e., B g,m # 1), there is a state with Q = - 2# - 1 
2 
for 
N 3 # # 2, and it becomes the ground state |# grd i. So, it is different from any state in the above two 
results. 
As to B g,m ! 1, when we fix m # 0, we have, of course, B g,m ! 1 for |g| ! 1. Moreover, we 
consider the low energy limit (infrared catastrophe) or high energy limit (ultraviolet catastrophe) in the 
following sense: set 
Im := Z R 3 
d 3 k |# (k) | 2 
! (k) %1 (1.57) 
as m # 0 for fixed #(k) or as #(k) ! 1 for fixed m. Then, we have B g,m !1 when m # 0 as long as g is 
fixed even if |g| is small or when #(k) ! 1 for fixed g and m. 
By using the manner to get [Hi, (2.73)] with a little modification, we get 
lim sup 
Bg,m!1 
E c 
B g,m 
= lim sup 
Bg,m!1 
I - 1 
m Z R 3 
d 3 k |# (k) | 2 
E c - !(k) 
. 
9 
And, we can prove that the right hand side of the above equality is zero in the same way as [Hi, (2.74)] 
with divergent Im by (1.57) or finite Im because E c ! 1 as B g,m ! 1, but the left hand side of the 
above equality is not zero in the same argument as that about the inequality after[Hi, (2.74)]. This is a 
contradiction. Therefore, 
E c } E grd for B g,m # 1. (1.58) 
Since E grd 6= 0 by (1.58), |# grd i is not a state with Q = 1 
2 
. Suppose that |# grd i is a state with 
Q = - 1 
2 
. Then, by [Hi, Lemma 2.1(b)] or by solving |# grd i with Q = - 1 
2 
directly, we know that |# grd i 
has the same form of (1.50) and (1.56). So, E grd must be a solution of D(z; g) = 0, since there is no 
solution but E c and E 0 c , we have E c = E grd , which contradicts (1.58). Therefore, |# grd i is a state with 
Q = - 2# - 1 
2 
for some N 3 # # 2. 
It is easy check that |p) and |ni (also |ni if it exists) are still state of H 
#- . 
Namely, we obtain 
[Q = - 2# - 1 
2 
with N 3 # # 2] If B g,# 1, then there always exists a ground state |# grd i with 
Q = - 2# - 1 
2 
for some N 3 # # 2 different from both |p) and |ni. Moreover, |p) and |ni (also |n 0 i if it exists) 
become excited states of H # , and the essential spectra of H # - is given as # ess (H # - ) = [E grd +m , 1). 
We note here that if the hypotheses in the above statement satisfies, then the ground state, # grd , always 
appears with Q = - 2# - 1 
2 for some N 3 # # 2. In this sense, the appearance of # grd is stable. We 
conjecture that the # in Q gets large as B g,# 1 grows. Although we cannot prove that yet, we can see 
the tendency in the Jaynes-Cummings model [Mi, 6.4] for our model as we show in the next section. 
2 Transition of Ground State of Lee Model 
In this section, we use !(k) = p k 2 + 2 defined in $ 1.1 for the sake of simplicity though we can 
treat more general !(k) with certain mathematical conditions. For each # 0 we take # (k) so that 
# (! (k)) / p ! (k) gets independent of # 0. So, we set # (k) := # (! (k)) / p 2! (k) independent of # 0, 
and we assume that # 2 L 2 (R d ), real-valued and continuous. 
We here employ special annihilation and creation operators for   V 
,   + V 
, and   N 
,   + N 
, namely we define 
them by Pauli's spin-flip matrices. Let state space F for H be the Hilbert space given by F := C 2 
#C 2 
#F b , 
where F b is a boson Fock space over L 2 (R d ). For operators A, B on C 2 and C acting on F b , we denote 
A# B #C acting on F by just ABC with abbreviation. Then, we set 
  V 
=   + N 
= # - # # 0 0 
1 0 # and   + V 
=   N 
= #+ # # 0 1 
0 0 # , (2.1) 
where #are Pauli's spin-flip matrices. So, the Hamiltonian H in this section has the following form: 
H = H 0 + gH I , 
where 
H 0 = m V 
  + V 
  V 
+ m N 
  + N 
  N 
+ Z R d 
d d k ! (k) # + #

H I = Z R d 
d d k #(k)   + V 
  N # # 
(k) +   V   + N 
# + # 
(k) # . (2.3) 
So, #(k) is a real-valued ultraviolet cutoff function independent of . We note here the following: we 
set H = C 2 
# C 2 , A = m V 
  + V 
  V 
+m N 
  + N 
  V 
, B 1 =   + V 
  N 
+   V 
  + N # / p 2, B 2 = i   + V 
  

N  V 
  + N # / p 2; 
# 1 = #, and # 2 = i#. Then, we know that the special Lee model is one example of the generalized 
spin-boson (GSB) model which we defined in [AH97]. 
The point eigenvalues # p (H 0 ) of H 0 are 0, m V 
, m N 
, m V 
+m N 
, i.e., # p (H 0 ) = {0, m V 
, m N 
, m V 
+m N }. 
The essential spectrum # ess (H 0 ) is [ 0 , 1 ), i.e., # ess (H 0 ) = [ 0 , 1 ), where # ess (T ) for a Hamiltonian T 
is the set of spectrum (energies) of T except simple or finitely degenerate discrete eigenvalues. 
By the way, we can decompose H into the direct sum of H 1 and H 2 , 
H = H 1 # H 2 , (2.4) 
10 
where 
H 1 := m V 
  + V 
  V

(k). (2.7) 
Then, since the infimum of the energy of H 2 is zero, the ground state of H 1 becomes that of H . Namely, 
to investigate the ground state of H we have only to study the ground state of H 1 . We denote the state 
space which H j acts on by F j for j = 1, 2. Then, F = F 1 # F 2 . Then, H 1 on F 1 is unitary equivalent 
to the Weisskopf-Wigner model argued in 1.3 and given by [Hi, (3.11)] (#, " + 
0 , " + 
1 in [Hi, (3.11)] are 
our g/2, m V 
, m N 
respectively). Therefore, we can understand that the regular renormalized mass m Vc 
satisfying 
m Vc 
= m V 
+ g 2 Z R d 
d d k |# (! (k)) | 2 
2! (k) 
1 
m Vc - (m N 
+ ! (k)) (2.8) 
represents the higher order revision for H 1 in Weisskopf-Wigner theory. Thus, m Vc 
does not have the 
same order in the coupling length as g 2 following from the regular perturbation theory. We note here 
that m Vc # g q R R 3 d 3 k |# (! (k)) | 2 /(2! (k)) as g ! 1, and the term with the order g vanishes in the 
regular perturbation theory as remarked in (1.52). 
By applying the argument in 1.3 for the case of } 0, and by applying [Sk, Theorem 3.1] for the cases 
of = 0, in the same way as [Hi, Proposition 2.1], we know that if #(k) has some proper mathematical 
conditions, then the normal renormalized mass m Vc 
is the ground state energy of H for such small |g| 
with fixed # 0 as d(g) &lt; 0, and moreover, other excited state energies are 0, m N , m V 
+m N 
only. More 
precisely, in the case of = 0, let 
g nor := # 2 Z R d 
d d k |#(k)| 2 # - 1 
, #(k) := @#(k) 
@|k| 
+ (d - 1) #(k) 
2|k| . (2.9) 
If d(g) &lt; 0 and ! - 1 # 2 L 2 (R d ), then the total number of bound states of H 1 defined by (2.5) is just 2 
for |g| &lt; g nor . Thus, the ground state energy of H is the normal renormalized mass m Vc 
for |g| &lt; g nor 
with = 0. 
By applying the argument 1.3 to the direct sum decomposition (2.4) to our special Lee model, for 
sufficiently large B g,# 1, we can prove mathematically the existence of the ground state different from 
|Vi so that the ground state energy is less than the energy of |Vi. Of course, it is not strange state such 
as Klln and Pauli showed in [KP], namely our ground state lies in the standard Hilbert space F . 
Namely, if B g,# 1, then there exists a ground state different from |Vi, and |Vi becomes an excited 
state of H . 
We have 
# p (H) # # E grd , m Vc 
, 0, m N 
, m V 
+ mN # 
with E grd &lt; m Vc 
&lt; 0 &lt; m N 
&lt; m V 
+ mN , (2.10) 
min {m V , m N } - B g,# E grd # 
m V 
+m N 

21 
4 B g,(2.11) 
for B g,# 1. Moreover, by [Ar00], we have 
# ess (H) = [E grd + , 1 ) (2.12) 
for B g,# 1. 
Therefore, H for B g,# 1 and H for B g,# 1 are different physics respectively, which gives a 
transition of ground state in the same way as H in 1.3. Moreover, by (2.11) the non-perturbative 
ground state energy recovers the order of the square in the coupling length when the Lee model is outside 
the region of the regular perturbation theory. In order to get such a ground state |# grd i, it is important 
that we balance the coupling length with the infrared singularity Isuch that (1.57) holds. Namely, even 
if |g| (resp. I) is large, the very small I(resp. |g|) breaks (1.57), which is not enough to get |# grd i. For 
11 
the appearance of |# grd i, we have to add not only the coupling length but also the infrared singularity 
IRinto sufficient condition. 
In the case of = 0 with (1.57), we cannot prove the self-adjointness for = 0 by the Kato-Rellich 
theorem [RS2, Theorem X.12], so we cannot apply the regular perturbation theory to this case. Of course, 
we cannot employ the regular perturbation theory in the case |g| # 1 with the fixed # 0. Therefore, 
|# grd i appears in the case beyond the perturbation theory. 
As to the extra bound states with non-standard resonance, the recent Billionnet's works [Bi98, Bi01] 
are interesting and worth noting. As remarked in [AH00, Remark 6.4] and [Hi, Remark 2.6], if we add 
an extra condition to #(k) in the same way as the case of the # decay, then an extra eigenvalues appears 
in [m N 
+ , 1), and it is different from E grd , m Vc 
, 0, and m V 
+mN . Billionnet showed in [Bi98, Bi01] 
that the reason why such eigenvalues appear is not for the result of the preceding complex eigenvalue 
of resonance turning into real eigenvalues when the coupling is continuously increased. We indeed knew 
that E grd , m Vc 
, 0, and m V +mN are stable for B g,# 1 in our Lee model. Moreover, Billionnet clarified 
in [Bi01] the way of appearance through the non-standard resonance. 
Once we have the ground state |# grd i different from |Vi, by applying [AH01, Theorem 3.1] in the 
same way as [AH01, Theorem 4.5], we obtain that there exist (g 0 , 0 ) in A := {(g , ) | g 2 R and with 
-w # d(g) &lt; 0 } such that Hd g=g 0 ,=0 
which is H with g = g 0 and = 0 has a degenerate ground 
states. And, there exist (g 1 , 1 
) in A such that inf # #(Hd g=g 1 ,=1 
) \ {E grd } # &lt; inf # ess (Hd g=g 1 ,=1 
). 
The conservation law (1.6) on the total number of V -particles and #-particles decomposes the state 
space F into the direct sum of some sectors as follows: 
For (1.6), we define the number operator N V # 
by 
N V # 
:=   + V 
  V 
+ N # (2.13) 
where N # denotes the number operator of #-particle, i.e., 
N # := Z R d 
d d k # + # 
(k)# # 
(k). (2.14) 
Then, the conservation law (1.6) is reflected in the relation, 
[H , N V # 
] = 0. (2.15) 
We denote the orthogonal projection onto the `-#-particle space in F b by P (`) 
# 
for each ` 2 N. Then, we 
get N # 
= P `=0 `P (`) 
# 
. Then, the spectral resolution of N V # 
is given by 
N V # 
= X `=0 
`P ` . (2.16) 
Here we set P (- 1) 
# # 0. 
We set F j (`) := P ` F j for j = 1, 2 and ` = 0, 1, 2, . Then, 
F 1 = 
1 
M `=0 
F 1 (`). (2.17) 
We denote the vacuum by |0i. Since |V i =   + V |0i and |N i =   + N |0i, we have 
|Vi = Z 1/2 
2 
(   + V |0i + g 0 Z R d 
d d k 
# 2 (k) 
m c - m N - ! (k)   + N # + # 
(k)|0i ) (2.18) 
by (1.8). Therefore, it is clear that |Vi is an eigenstate of H 1 with 
|Vi 2 F 1 (1). (2.19) 
Since our ground state # grd still lives in the standard state space F , # grd has to belong to one of 
the sectors F 1 (`)'s (` 2 {0} [ N). Of course, # g has the positive norm because it is in the standard 
state space, which is a difference from the Klln and Pauli's state |VKP i. Moreover, their state |VKP i 
belongs to the sector F 1 (1), but our # grd does not belong to F 1 (1). Because, we can prove in the same 
way as [Hi, Lemma 2.1(c)] that |# grd i = c|Vi for some complex constant c contradicts the fact that the 
the ground state energy is less than m Vc 
. Therefore, |# grd i is different from |VKP i. 
12 
3 Superradiant Ground State(?) 
In the previous section, we proved mathematically that the ground state |# grd i another from |Vi appears, 
and |Vi becomes an excited state of H . We are interested in the physical reason of the appearance of 
such a ground state |# grd i. 
We have to note that the ground state of H does not have the form of (1.23) in spite of (1.5), (1.6), 
and (1.26). Moreover, since E grd is much lower than m Vc 
, V -particle has to emit so many #-particles. But 
considering (1.5), (1.6), and (1.26), such a emission is not observable in the reaction (1.4), namely, the 
emission is prohibited from breaking the conservation laws (1.5) and (1.6). Moreover, remember that the 
infrared singularity (1.57) plays an important role for the existence of # grd with fixed the coupling length 
g, and that for each concrete model the individual coupling constant is fixed. Thus, such #-particles may 
be like soft photons. Although we cannot give concretely a form of the ground state, we can consider 
the Jaynes-Cummings model [Mi, 6.4] in the light of quantum optics, the case of #-particle for the mode 
with k (i.e., one mode), at very low energy (or mass). 
We consider the following Hamiltonian H(k) for the system of V -particle, N-particle, and #-particle 
for the mode with k: 
H(k) := m V   + V 
  V 
+ m N   + N 
  N 
+!(k)# + # 
(k)# # 
(k) + g#(k)   + V 
  N # # 
(k) +   V   + N 
# + # 
(k) # , (3.1) 
where we employed (2.1) again. F 1 
b (k) is the state space of one-mode #-particle with k. Then, all 
eigenvalues E n k 
(n k 
= 0, 1, 2, ) of H(k) are given as 
E n k 
= # n k 
+ 1 
2 # ! (k) + m V 
+m N 
2 q (m N 
+ ! (k) - m V 
) 2 + 4g 2 # 2 (k) (n k 
+ 1) , 
n = 0, 1, 2, , 
where n k 
is the number of #-particles for the mode with k. So, F b (k) is spanned by {|n k i} 1 n k =0 
. As we 
saw in (1.25), m N 
+ ! (k) - m V 
becomes a shift of a frequency from the resonance, so 
q (m N 
+ ! (k) - m V 
) 2 + 4g 2 # 2 (k) (n k 
+ 1) in (3.2) is equal to a general quantized Rabi flopping 
frequency [MS, WM], which leads us to the spontaneous emission of the photon with a single mode. The 
eigenstate |# n k i for E n k 
is in F 1 (n k 
+ 1). Therefore, for instance, we set #(k) # 1 now for the sake of 
simplicity, and 
g = 10 L , !(k) = 
10- L , n k 
= 10 4L- 2 or g = 1, !(k) = 
10- 3L , n k 
= 10 4L- 2 
for sufficiently large L 2 N. Then, we obtain 
E - 10 
4L- 2 # -  g,(k) = - g 2 
!(k) 
with 
E - 10 4L- 2 # - 0.09 10 3L 
,g 2 
!(k) # - 10 3L (3.2) 
as L ! 1. This means that the eigenvalue with the same order 
as- g 2 /!(k) is obtained as n k , |g| # 
1 # !(k) or n k # 1 # !(k) for fixed g. Moreover, the eigenstate with such an eigenvalue belongs to the 
sector, F 1 (10 4L- 2 + 1), and switches to another sector with larger number of #-particle as L !1. 
4 Conclusion 
Following the renormalizable field theory by Lee, Klln and Pauli, in order to avoid a ghost, m c , g c , and 
# are restricted as we know from (1.14). On the other hand, m c g, and # are chosen so that g c can catch 
g obs . For the large coupling, we cannot employ the perturbative way to get the renormalized constant 
and renormalized coupling constant any longer. Even in the case |g| is not so large, if we have the case 
with the infrared singularity condition (1.57), then the effective mass is different from m Vc 
. Moreover, in 
the case of B g,# 1, we have to consider not only Z ren 
Vc 
but also the renormalized constant for |# grd i to 
argue whether |# grd i is a ghost or not. 
13 
The interaction Hamiltonian H I of the Lee model is given through the rotating wave approximation 
(RWA) or the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. If we can check that the mathematical results of (2.10
)(2.12) are not realistic in physics, then we know the limit of the domain of B g,and d(g), i.e., the 
coupling constants g and the condition of the ultraviolet cutoff function #(k) of the Lee model, so the 
limit of RWA in a sense. But if we hope the results of (2.10)-(2.12) are realistic in physics, we have to 
prove the same results independent of RWA, and to develop the renormalizable field theory so that it can 
include the case such as B g,# 1. 
Is the existence of |# grd i caused by the Rabi flopping? If it is correct, the phases may get harmonious 
by revival with very small |k| after they are disordered by the Cummings collapse in the Rabi flopping. 
Namely, are there any relation between superradiant ground state by Preparata and the Rabi flopping?</body>
