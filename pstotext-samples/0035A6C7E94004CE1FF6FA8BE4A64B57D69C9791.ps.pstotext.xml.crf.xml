    <body>1 Introduction 
Digital watermarking represents an effective 
solution to the increasing demand for copyright 
protection mechanisms. A codemark is 
indissolubly embedded into the image to be 
protected, to allow the identification of its creator, 
owner, authorized author, and so on. Several 
systems have been proposed which hide some 
information in the spatial domain [5, 7] or in a 
transformed domain of the image [1, 3, 4, 6, 8], 
trying to fulfill the contrasting requirements of 
robustness and unobtrusiveness. In this paper, 
the problem of how a decision threshold for a 
correlation-based watermark detection system 
[1] can be selected, is discussed; the threshold 
is chosen according to a fixed constraint on the 
maximum probability of false positive errors in 
watermark detection. 
Here, the watermark consists of a set of n 
normally distributed samples fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n g 
which are used to modify a selected set V of 
full-frame DCT coefficients. In particular, the 
coefficients from the (k + 1)th to the (k + n)th 
in the zig-zag ordering of the DCT spectrum 
are selected and modified, according to the 
following rule: 
v X;i = v i + ffjv i jx i ; (1) 
where v i is the original DCT coefficient, x i 
the watermark sample, v X;i the modified 
coefficients, and ff is a properly chosen 
parameter tuning the watermark energy: the higher 
the ff, the more robust and the more visible 
the watermark. By denoting the component 
by component multiplication of vectors X and 
V by XV , equation 1 can be put in the more 
compact form VX = V + ffXjV j. 
During detection, the correlation between 
the marked and possibly corrupted coefficients 
V 0 and the watermark itself is computed and 
used as a measure of the presence of a given 
mark X. More precisely, given a mark X and 
a set of possibly corrupted and watermarked 
DCT coefficients V 0 , the correlation ae(X; V 0 ) 
between X and V 0 , defined as 
ae(X; V 0 ) = X \Delta V 0 
n 
= 1

can be used to determine whether a given mark 
is present or not, by simply comparing it to a 
predefined threshold. 
2 Statistical analysis for 
threshold selection 
It is important for a correct behaviour of 
the watermark detection system, to properly 
choose the decision threshold. Let us consider 
a scenario in which the decoder is presented 
a grey level image and it is asked to decide 
whether a given mark X is embedded in the 
image. Only one of the following situations is 
possible: 
Hp.A: V 0 = V 
i.e. the image is not marked; 
Hp.B: V 0 = V + ffY jV j 
i.e. a mark Y 6= X is present; 
Hp.C: V 0 = V + ffXjV j 
i.e. the mark X is present. 
For the present application, i. e. to decide 
whether the mark X has been embedded in the 
image or not, hypothesis A and B are 
equivalent, and can be grouped together: 
Hp.0 = Hp.A or Hp.B: 
the image is not marked with X; 
Hp.1 = Hp.C: 
the image is marked with X. 
To discriminate between Hp:0 and Hp:1, the 
decoder computes ae(X; V 0 ) and compares it 
with a threshold T ae , if ae(X; V 0 ) is lower than 
T ae then the decoder decides the image is not 
marked with X, whereas if ae(X; V 0 ) is above 
the threshold, the decoder assumes the image 
is marked with X. To determine the value of 
T ae , the decoder error probability can be taken 
into account. The error probability P e , i.e. the 
probability of deciding for the wrong 
hypothesis, can be written as: 
P e = P (0j1)P (1) + P (1j0)P (0); (3) 
where P (0j1) is the probability of missing the 
presence of the mark (false negative), and 
P (1j0) the probability of revealing the presence 
of X when X is not actually present (false 
positive), P (0) and P (1) the a priori probability 
of Hp:0 and Hp:1. By assuming that Hp:0 and 
Hp:1 are equiprobable, and by taking into 
account the particular decoding strategy, eq.(3) 
can be put in the form: 
P e = 1 
2 
h 
P (ae ! T ae j1) + P (ae ? T ae j0) 
i 
: (4) 
where ae = ae(X; V 0 ). 
To go on with the computation of P e , the 
statistic of ae(X; V 0 ) must be considered. Let 
us note first that by invoking the central limit 
theorem, ae can be assumed to be normally 
distributed. It is possible to demonstrate [1] that, 
when ff 2 1, if hypothesis Hp:0 holds 
aejHp:0 = 0 (5) 
and 
oe 2 
aejHp:0 = (1 + ff 2 ) oe 2 
v 
n 
(6) 
and if hypothesis Hp:1 holds, we set 
aejHp:1 = ff jvj (7) 
and 
oe 2 
aejHp:1 = (1 + 2ff 2 ) oe 2 
v 
n 
+ ff 2 
oe 2

n 
(8) 
where 
jvj = 1 
n 
n

i=1 
E[jv i j] (9) 
is the average value of jv i j over the set of 
marked coefficients, and 
oe 2 
v = 1 
n 
n 
X 
i=1 
E[v 2 
i ] (10) 
is the average value of oe 2 
v i 
over the set of 
marked coefficients. If ff 2 1, we can write: 
oe 2 
aejHp:0 ' oe 2 
aejHp:1 ' oe 2 
v 
n 
, oe 2 
ae : (11) 
In fig.1 the pdf's of ae under hypotheses 0 and 
1 are shown. In order to minimize the error 
probability, a threshold T ae has to be chosen 
such that P (0j1) + P (1j0) is minimum. Under 
the condition ff 1, P (0j1) = P (1j0), so that 
Figure 1: The pdf's of ae under hypotheses 0 
and 1. Attacks are not considered. 
Figure 2: The pdf's of ae under hypotheses 0 
and 1. Attacks are now considered. 
the optimum threshold is midway between zero 
and aejHp:1 , that is 
T ae = ff 
2 jvj (12) 
For the above analysis to be successfully 
applied to practical situations, two considerations 
are in order. On the basis of statistical analysis 
[2], we have assumed jvj = 0:7; however, if an 
image is attacked this value can be 
considerably different so that an error is likely to occur 
when comparing ae(X; V 0 ) with T ae . In practical 
applications, then, it is better for the decoder 
to use a threshold T ae which is estimated on the 
marked image, i.e. we assume 
jvj ' 1 
n 
n 
X 
i=1 
jv 0 
i j (13) 
The second consideration concerns the choice 
of T ae when the image has been corrupted 
by intentional or unintentional attacks. In 
such a case, the analysis carried out so far 
is no longer valid, since both the mean value 
and the variance of ae(X; V 0 ) may be altered 
because of attacks. In general, it can be 
stated that in presence of attacks the oe ae(X;V ) 
and oe ae(X;V Y ) should remain approximately the 
same, whereas oe ae(X;V X ) is likely to increase 
significantly. Therefore, we can say that because 
of attacks, two gaussians are still present, but 
the one centered in jvj has now a significantly 
larger variance. This suggested that T ae should 
be set closer to zero, instead of midway 
between zero and jvj (see fig.2), so that T ae has 
been fixed [1] to 
T ae = ff 
3 jvj (14) 
3 A new threshold selection 
However, experimental results have shown that 
when the watermarked image is attacked the 
proposed threshold leads to a higher watermark 
missing rate than was expected. In 
particular, the probability of missing an embedded 
watermark results to be considerably higher than 
the probability of false positive detection, i.e. 
the probability to detect a watermark which 
is not really present in the image. This can 
be explained by the fact that under attacks 
it usually happens that aejHp:1 ! ff jvj (see 
fig.3). To solve this problem, a different 
approach for threshold selection has been found. 
In this case, instead of trying to minimize the 
error probability P e , it is chosen to fix a 
constrain on the maximum false positive 
probability (e.g. 
10\Gamma 6 ), so that the threshold is moved 
leftmost (see again fig.3). In particular, given 
P f = P (ae ? T ae j0) = 1 
2 erfc( T ae 
p 
2oe 2 
ae 
) = 
10\Gamma 6 , 
the following relation holds: 
T ae 
q 
2oe 2 
ae 
3:3 (15) 
in such a way that a new threshold is 
obtained: 
T ae = 3:3 
q 
2oe ae 2 = 3:3 
s 
2(1 + ff 2 )oe v 2 
n 
(16) 
Once again, the threshold can be evaluated 
directly on the watermarked and possibly 
corrupted image: the value (1 + ff 2 )oe v 2 
corresponds, in fact, to oe v 0 
2 so that we have: 
T ae = 3:3 
s 
2oe v 0 
2 
n 
(17)

based on a constrain on the maximum false 
positive probability. 
4 Experimental results 
In the following, experimental results will 
be shown proving that the new threshold 
choice improves the characteristics of 
robustness against attacks of the proposed 
watermarking system, and confirming the 
aforementioned analysis. In particular, the thresholds 
T ae = ff 
3 jv 0 j and T 0 
ae = 3:3

n will be 
compared, highlighting the improvement of 
performance of the system with respect to the correct 
detection of the watermark. The standard

image "Lenna" in Figure 4 was signed with 
parameter ff = 0.2, with a watermarking random 
sequence of length n = 16000, and skipping the 
first k = 16000 coefficients in the zig-zag scan, 
to obtain a watermarked copy shown in 
Figure 5. The detector was applied to this copy: 
as shown in Figure 6, the new threshold T 0 
ae 
is lower than the old threshold T ae , but much 
higher again with respect to the responses to 
the other watermarks, so that no false positive 
watermark detection could happen. 
To verify the effectiveness of the new 
threshold in the watermark detection of attacked 
images, some modifications of "Lenna" were 
carried out: first, a JPEG compression with 
quality factor of 5% was applied; the results of 
the decoder are shown in Figure 7: the new 
threshold T 0 
ae is lower than the correct response, 
whereas the old threshold T ae is higher than 
the response, so that using T ae a missed 
detection would occur. Then, the sequence of 
JPEG compression with quality factor of 15%, 
despeckle filtering, and dithering to only 4 grey 
levels, was applied, obtaining the image in 
Figure 8. Once again, by using the threshold T 0 
ae 
the embedded watermark is correctly detected, 
whereas by using T ae it would be missed (see 
Figure 9). Similar results were obtained also 
carrying out other attacks, like median and low 
pass filtering, sharpening, blurring.

5 Conclusions 
In this paper, the problem of how a decision 
threshold for a correlation-based watermark 
detection algorithm can be properly chosen is 
addressed; to determine whether a given 
watermark is present or not, the correlation ae(X; V ) 
between the watermark X and a set of selected 
DCT coefficients is computed, and compared to 
a threshold T ae . It has been demonstrated that, 
if a watermarked image is attacked through 
signal processing techniques, the statistic of the 
correlation changes, resulting in an higher false 
negative error probability than was expected. 
To cope with this effect, a new threshold based 
on a fixed constraint on the maximum 
probability of false positive errors is proposed. Results 
confirm the robustness of the decoder against 
the attacks.
